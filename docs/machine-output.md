# Machine-readable output

Every command speaks three mutually exclusive machine formats.

```sh
zot --json list       # one versioned document
zot --jsonl list      # one self-describing document per line
zot --raw list        # Zotero's own response, untouched
```

## `--json`

`--json` wraps stable zotgo DTOs in a versioned envelope. The shape is the same
for every command, so a script learns it once:

```json
{
  "schema": 2,
  "kind": "items",
  "library": { "type": "user", "id": 0, "name": "My Library" },
  "data": [ { "key": "AAAA1111", "type": "journalArticle", "title": "Algae paper" } ],
  "meta": { "shown": 25, "total": 312 }
}
```

`kind` says what `data` holds: `items`, `item`, `annotations`, `annotation`,
`collections`, `collection`, `stats`, or `health`. A `health` document carries
`endpoint` and `capabilities`,
so a script can check for `write` support rather than assume it. `schema` is
bumped only when a field changes meaning or disappears — new fields may appear at
any time, so ignore the ones you don't know.

### Annotations

`zot --json annotation list ATTACHMENT_KEY` emits an ordered `annotations`
array. Each record carries the annotation and attachment keys, annotation type,
page label, color, Zotero sort index, and `hasText`/`hasComment` flags. Text,
comment bodies, and document position data are intentionally absent. JSONL uses
the singular `annotation` kind for each self-describing record.

`--raw` fetches all result pages and joins their complete Zotero annotation item
envelopes into one array. Envelope fields are not reshaped, but both their shape
and server order remain outside the stable contract.

### No `version` field

Items, collections, and stable annotation records carry **no `version`**. A Zotero object version belongs to
the endpoint that issued it, and the Local API's has no meaning zotgo can promise:
it is the *server* version, so it does not move when you edit an item locally
without syncing, and the local write API replaces it with an unrelated local
counter. Sending one to the Web API as a write precondition is a data-integrity
hazard. If you need Zotero's number anyway, take it from `--raw`, which is
explicitly outside this contract.

## `--jsonl`

`--jsonl` emits one document per line, each repeating `schema`, `kind`, and
`library`. Every line therefore stands alone, and a stream survives being
truncated, split, or concatenated with another:

```sh
zot --jsonl list | jq -r '.data | "\(.key)\t\(.title)"'
```

## `--raw`

`--raw` passes Zotero's API response straight through. It is an escape hatch for
fields zotgo does not model, and it is **not covered by `schema`**: its shape is
Zotero's and changes when Zotero changes. `stats` and `doctor` reject `--raw`,
because zotgo derives them and there is no underlying Zotero response.
