# Zotero integration contracts (verified 2026-07-07)

zotgo talks to a **running Zotero 7+ desktop app** over two HTTP surfaces on
`localhost:23119`. It never touches `zotero.sqlite`. This file is the verified
reference for both surfaces; everything below was captured against a live
Zotero (client `9.0.4`, Local API v3, schema 42, `~8784047` user, 13 groups,
2203 items in My Library).

The two surfaces:

| Surface | Path prefix | Purpose | Default state |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Local API** (read) | `/api/*` | read library data, server-side export | **OFF by default** (`httpServer.localAPI.enabled`) |
| **Connector API** (write) | `/connector/*` | create items/attachments, snapshots | on whenever Zotero runs |

Both require Zotero to be running. This is the central constraint: **zotgo has
no headless/offline mode**.

---

## 1. Local API (read) — `/api/*`

Web-API-v3-compatible. Same JSON envelope and headers as `api.zotero.org`, so
the online API docs (`_reference/zotero-upstream/zotero-docs/content/dev/web_api/`)
apply. Served by `server_localAPI.js`.

### Availability / probe

- `GET /api/` → `200 "Nothing to see here."` when reachable. This no-op is the
  version-agnostic probe (it ignores API-version mismatch).
- When the pref is **off**, every `/api/*` route except `/api/` returns
  `403 text/plain "Local API is not enabled"`. zotgo must detect this exact
  case and tell the user how to enable it (Settings → Advanced → "Allow other
  applications on this computer to communicate with Zotero" + Local API).
- Connection refused → Zotero not running.

### Response envelope

Every item/collection object:

```json
{
  "key": "HRAC4E44",
  "version": 3579,
  "library": { "type": "user", "id": 8784047, "name": "My Library", "links": {…} },
  "links":   { "self": {…}, "alternate": {…}, "attachment": { "href": ".../items/CWEW5DNC", "attachmentType": "application/pdf", "attachmentSize": 585858 } },
  "meta":    { "creatorSummary": "Posten", "parsedDate": "2009-06", "numChildren": 1 },
  "data":    { "key": "…", "version": 3579, "itemType": "journalArticle", "title": "…", "creators": [...], "tags": [...], "collections": [...] }
}
```

- `data` is polymorphic by `itemType`. Decode as a typed envelope with
  `Data json.RawMessage`; unmarshal fields on demand.
- `meta` gives server-derived fields pyzot rebuilt by hand from SQL:
  `creatorSummary`, `parsedDate`, `numChildren`. Free.
- `links.attachment` inlines the primary attachment (type + size) on a
  top-level item — no extra round trip to know it has a PDF.

### Response headers (pagination + versioning)

```
Total-Results: 2203
Last-Modified-Version: 3579
Link: <…?limit=1&start=1>; rel="next", <…?start=2202>; rel="last"
Zotero-Schema-Version: 42
```

- **Pagination**: follow `Link rel="next"` or page with `start`/`limit`.
- **Counts are free**: `GET …?limit=1` and read `Total-Results` (this is how
  `zot stats` should count without pulling rows).
- `Last-Modified-Version` enables cheap change-detection / caching later.

### Route map (from `server_localAPI.js`)

Item routes exist under **both** `/api/users/:userID/…` and `/api/groups/:groupID/…`:

```
/api/users/:userID/items                      list all items
/api/users/:userID/items/top                  top-level only (parents)
/api/users/:userID/items/trash                trashed
/api/users/:userID/items/tags                 tags in item set
/api/users/:userID/items/:itemKey             one item
/api/users/:userID/items/:itemKey/children    attachments + notes
/api/users/:userID/items/:itemKey/file        302 redirect to the local file URL
/api/users/:userID/items/:itemKey/file/view/url  local file URL
/api/users/:userID/items/:itemKey/fulltext    full-text content (per item)
/api/users/:userID/collections[/top]          collections (tree via parentCollection)
/api/users/:userID/collections/:key           one collection
/api/users/:userID/collections/:key/items[/top]  items in a collection
/api/users/:userID/collections/:key/collections  subcollections
/api/users/:userID/searches/:searchKey/items  saved-search results
/api/users/:userID/tags                       all tags
/api/users/:userID/groups                     groups (list)
/api/groups/:groupID                          one group
```

Schema surface (no library id needed):

```
/api/                 no-op probe / version
/api/schema           full Zotero schema (200)
/api/itemTypes        [{itemType, localized}, …]
/api/itemFields
/api/itemTypeFields
/api/itemTypeCreatorTypes
/api/creatorFields
```

### Query parameters

- `limit`, `start` — pagination.
- `q` + `qmode=titleCreatorYear|everything` — search (verified: `q=algae&itemType=journalArticle` → 3; `q=photobioreactor&qmode=everything` → 2).
- `itemType=journalArticle` (supports `||`/`-` boolean per web API).
- `itemKey=KEY1,KEY2` — restrict to specific keys (verified live 2026-07-10).
  On `/items` Zotero *also* returns the matched items' children; on `/items/top`
  it returns exactly the requested keys. An empty `itemKey=` is ignored, not
  treated as "match nothing".
- `format=json|bibtex|csljson|ris|biblatex|mods|tei|rdf_*|csv|…` — **server-side
  export via Zotero's translators** (all verified 200 live: bibtex, csljson, ris,
  biblatex, mods, tei, rdf_bibliontology, Zotero-native csv). Expose these
  generically through one `format=` passthrough, not one method per format. Note
  the Zotero-native `csv` differs from zotgo's hand-rolled summary csv.
  `include=bib,citation` and `style=` also apply.
- `sort`, `direction`.

### Export page-boundary behavior (verified live 2026-07-10, Zotero 9.0.4)

Confirmed against a real 1093-item library by forcing `limit=1` over an
`itemKey=`-scoped query. Previously inferred from document structure only.

- **bibtex / biblatex / ris** — one record per entry; pages concatenate cleanly.
- **csljson** — each page is a JSON array; they splice into one array.
- **Zotero-native `csv`** — the *full* header row **is** repeated on every page,
  so header-dedupe is correct. **Each page is also prefixed with a UTF-8 BOM**
  (`EF BB BF`). Go's `encoding/csv` does not treat the BOM specially: it becomes
  part of the first field, and the quote that follows reads as a bare quote in an
  unquoted field, so parsing fails outright. Strip the BOM per page and re-emit
  one on the merged document (Zotero emits it so spreadsheets detect UTF-8).
  A BOM may also legitimately appear *inside* a field value — only strip the
  leading one.
- **mods / tei / rdf_\*** — each page is a complete document wrapping its records
  in a single root (`<modsCollection>`, `<listBibl>`, `<rdf:RDF>`); mods and tei
  additionally emit an `<?xml?>` declaration per page. Concatenation is therefore
  never valid; multi-page requests must be refused.
- Zotero's CSV translator **skips standalone attachments**: a library with 1093
  top-level items (19 of them standalone attachments) exports 1074 CSV rows.
  That omission is Zotero's, not a merge defect.

### The `/file` endpoint = a storage-path simplification, not byte streaming

`GET /items/:key/file` returns a `302` redirect to the attachment's local
`file://` URL; `GET /items/:key/file/view/url` returns the same local file URL
as `text/plain`. zotgo does **not** need to know the Zotero data-dir /
`storage/<key>/` layout that pyzot resolved by hand, but attachment access is
"ask Zotero for the file URL, then open/read that path" rather than a plain HTTP
byte stream. Do not assume a normal HTTP client following redirects will fetch
the bytes correctly.

### Library-id / user-vs-group routing (correctness-critical)

- `userID = 0` is accepted and resolved to the logged-in user (responses report
  the real id, e.g. `8784047`). Groups use their real numeric id.
- `GET /api/users/0/groups` → `[{id, version, meta:{numItems}, data:{id,name,description}}]`.
- **Restriction (from source):** *"No access to user data for users other than
  the local logged-in user."* Single-user only; you cannot read another user's
  personal library.
- zotgo must map its notion of "which library" → either `users/<uid>` or
  `groups/<gid>`. Getting this wrong reads the wrong library silently. This is
  the #1 correctness risk carried over from pyzot's issue-4 analysis.

### Local write contract (MERGED to zotero main 2026-07-28, unreleased)

`zotero/zotero#5015` was **merged** (as commits 9dd17a2, 77f2432, a37a9e7;
dstillman finished AbeJellinek's branch). Read from the merged
`server_localAPI.js`, so **observed in code**, not inferred — but **not in any
release**: Zotero 9.0.4 does not have it, so per the iron rule zotgo cannot ship
writes until we can run against a Zotero built with these commits.

**Endpoints & methods** (mirror Web API v3 write semantics):

- `POST /api/local/authorize` — obtain a **local API key** (local-only; no web
  analog). Body `{"appName":"zotgo"}` → Zotero modal (Allow / Always Allow /
  Deny). 200 `{"key":"<key>","remember":<bool>}`; 403 `{"denied":true}`; 400 if
  appName blank; 429 + `Retry-After` if rate-limited. "Allow" keys are
  **single-use** (consumed by the first successful write) → always handle 401 by
  re-authorizing.
- Batch create/delete on the collection routes: `POST`/`DELETE`
  `/…/items`, `/…/collections` (`DELETE` multi-key via query param, ≤50).
- Per-object: `PUT`/`PATCH`/`DELETE` `/…/items/:key`, `/…/collections/:key`.
- `MAX_WRITE_OBJECTS = 50`, `MAX_DELETE_OBJECTS = 50`.

**Auth & headers:**

- Writes require the local API key via `Zotero-API-Key` (or `?key=`); missing/bad
  → 401.
- **`Zotero-Server-ID`**: a stable per-database id on **every** response.
  Optional on reads, **required on writes** (missing → 428 Precondition Required;
  mismatch → 412 Precondition Failed). Its *presence on a read* is the clean
  probe signal that this Zotero has the write API at all.
- **`If-Unmodified-Since-Version`** required on writes, checked against the
  library's `clientVersion` (mismatch → 412 with expected/found). `?since=` and
  `If-Modified-Since-Version` gate reads. `Last-Modified-Version` on responses.

**Response shapes** (identical to Web API v3, so the parser is shared):

- Batch → 200 `{"successful":{"<i>":<obj>}, "success":{…}, "unchanged":{"<i>":"<key>"},
  "failed":{"<i>":{"key","code","message"}}}`.
- Single `PUT`/`PATCH`/`DELETE` → 204. File registration → 204.

**Managed attachment files** use the API-v3 full-upload contract for an existing
`imported_file` or `imported_url` attachment. The client first creates attachment
metadata without `filename`/`path`/`md5`/`mtime`, then:

1. `POST /api/…/items/:key/file` with form-encoded MD5, bare filename, byte
   length, millisecond mtime, media type, and `If-None-Match: *`.
2. Stream the bytes to the returned same-origin `/api/local/uploads/:uploadKey`
   receiver; this key-scoped request carries no API credential.
3. Repeat the authenticated form POST with `upload=:uploadKey` and the same
   precondition to register the staged file.

The receiver verifies MD5 but not the claimed byte length. A focused item read
must verify the parent, `imported_file` link mode, filename, MD5, and advertised
enclosure length. zotgo caps imports at 128 MiB because the current Local API
receiver buffers each request in memory before staging it to disk. Registration returns 204. This deterministic Local
API workflow is distinct from Connector ingestion and can target an arbitrary
existing bibliographic parent.

**Versioning is endpoint-scoped, in Zotero's own words:** *"Local API versions
have no relation to Web API versions, nor … to local API versions returned by
other Zotero instances."* This is exactly zotgo's schema-2 decision to keep
`version` out of the DTOs — vindicated. `clientVersion` is a new per-library
counter, incremented once per library per transaction.

The already-shipped **Web API** provides official remote CRUD today (its writes
use the same batch response shape). The durable axis is local vs remote
endpoint, not read vs write.

## 2. Connector API (ingestion) — `/connector/*`

Served by `server_connector.js`. Same surface the browser extension uses; always
available when Zotero runs (no pref gate). Writes go through Zotero itself, so
`zotero.sqlite` integrity is Zotero's responsibility.

**Ingestion adapter only, not a general write backend.** `saveItems` writes to
`getSaveTarget()` — Zotero's currently-selected library/collection — and
silently redirects to My Library when that target is not editable
(verified in source). That nondeterminism disqualifies it for general
automation; use it only for app-mediated workflows (recognition, import,
snapshots). General resource writes belong on the official API write contract.

### Registered endpoints (from `server_connector.js`)

```
/connector/ping                      liveness ("Zotero is running")
/connector/detect                    run detection on a URL
/connector/getTranslators            list translators
/connector/getTranslatorCode
/connector/saveItems                 save translated item metadata → library
/connector/saveSnapshot              save a web snapshot
/connector/saveSingleFile            single-file snapshot
/connector/saveStandaloneAttachment  upload a local file as standalone attachment
/connector/saveAttachment
/connector/saveAttachmentFromResolver
/connector/getRecognizedItem         poll: did a saved PDF get recognized into a parent?
/connector/getSelectedCollection     current target collection in the UI
/connector/updateSession             attach tags/collection to a just-saved session
/connector/import                    import RIS / BibTeX / CSL text
/connector/installStyle
/connector/proxies  /connector/delaySync  /connector/getClientHostnames  /connector/hasAttachmentResolvers
```

### Write choreography (mined from pyzot's `write/`)

- **Local file** → `POST /connector/saveStandaloneAttachment` with raw bytes,
  `Content-Type`, and an `X-Metadata` header carrying `{sessionID, title, url:
  file://…}`. Response is `{canRecognize}` in current source; do **not** assume
  the new attachment key is returned.
- **Recognition** (PDF → parent metadata): poll `POST /connector/getRecognizedItem`
  with the sessionID — this is the *correct* API replacement for pyzot's SQL
  polling hack (`wait_for_recognized_parent` reaching into the DB). Current
  response shape is recognized parent display data (`title`, `itemType`), not a
  Zotero item key.
- **Tags / collection** → `POST /connector/updateSession` with the sessionID
  after the save.
- **Collection/library target** → `POST /connector/updateSession` expects a
  Zotero tree target (`L<libraryID>` or `C<collectionID>`). Resolve explicit
  `--collection` names through `POST /connector/getSelectedCollection`, whose
  `targets` array exposes those IDs for editable libraries/collections. Local
  API collection keys are not sufficient for `updateSession`.
- **RIS / BibTeX / CSL file** → `POST /connector/import` (no local parsing).
- **Identifier (DOI/arXiv/PMID/ISBN)** → resolve identifier to item JSON, then
  `POST /connector/saveItems`. The connector does *not* resolve identifiers for
  you headlessly; pyzot supplied its own resolvers.
- **Session model**: every write flow generates a client `sessionID` and threads
  it through save → recognize → updateSession.
- **Existing-item attachments/collection assignment**: connector attachment and
  session-update operations are session-bound, so Connector remains unsuitable
  for arbitrary existing items. Managed attachment files now use the Local API
  upload contract above. Arbitrary collection assignment still needs an API
  contract rather than direct SQLite writes.

## 3. Web API (remote reads) — `api.zotero.org` (verified live 2026-07-28)

The hosted Web API is API-v3 like the Local API, so the same semantic client
serves it — but several contract details differ and were **observed** against a
real key (user 8784047), not inferred:

- **No `/api` prefix; real user id.** Routes are `/users/<id>/…` and
  `/groups/<id>/…`. The `<id>` is the key owner's real numeric id (from
  `/keys/current`), not the Local API's `0` sentinel.
- **Auth.** `Zotero-API-Key: <key>` header (the documented current form; the
  `?key=` query param is deprecated and would leak the key into logs).
- **`GET /keys/current`** returns `{"userID", "username", "access":{"user":{…},
  "groups":{…}}}`. The `access` grants (`library`, `write`, `files`, `notes`)
  are the endpoint's own statement of what the key may do — so web capabilities
  are **probe-derived**, unlike the local write capability, which no probe can
  determine. A 403/404 here means the key is missing/revoked/wrong.
- **csljson is wrapped differently.** The Local API returns a bare array
  `[…]` per page; the **Web API returns `{"items":[…]}`**. zotgo unwraps both to
  one bare CSL-JSON array, so `zot export csljson` output is endpoint-neutral.
  *This bit us:* the httptest fakes served the local bare-array shape, so the
  merge passed every unit test and failed on the first real web export — the
  live web suite caught it (cf. the CSV-BOM finding).
- **Pagination differs for scoped exports.** An `itemKey=`-scoped `format=csljson`
  query returns all matches in **one** page (`limit` is ignored; `Total-Results`
  equals the match count, no `Link` next), where the Local API paginates the
  same query one item per page. The unwrap-and-splice merge handles both.
- **Rate limiting** (Web-only): `429`/`503` carry `Retry-After: <seconds>`
  (honored with bounded retries); a `Backoff: <seconds>` header asks the client
  to slow down (honored between paginated pages). The Local API never sends these.

## 4. What this buys zotgo over pyzot (concrete)

- No private-schema coupling (pyzot pinned SQLite schema v107).
- Reads while Zotero is **running** (pyzot's WAL lock effectively wanted it closed).
- `meta.*` server-derived fields for free (creatorSummary/parsedDate/numChildren).
- **Server-side export** (`format=bibtex|csljson`) → no `pybtex` reimplementation.
- Attachment file URLs via `/file` → no storage-dir path resolution.
- Recognition via `/connector/getRecognizedItem` → no DB polling hack.

## 5. What it costs

- Zotero must be running for **everything**.
- Local API is **off by default** → first-run enablement friction.
- Single logged-in user only.
- Identifier→metadata resolution is not provided by the local surfaces.
