# zotgo (`zot`)

A single, zero-dependency Go binary that drives a running
[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) 7+ through its own HTTP contracts — browse,
search, export, and edit your library from the command line. It talks to Zotero
the way Zotero wants to be talked to: over HTTP, never through `zotero.sqlite`.

zotgo is the from-scratch successor to
[`pyzot`](https://github.com/CameronBrooks11/pyzot).

## Install

```bash
go install github.com/CameronBrooks11/zotgo/cmd/zot@latest
```

Or grab a prebuilt binary from the [Releases] page — no runtime, no dependencies.

[Releases]: https://github.com/CameronBrooks11/zotgo/releases

## Quickstart

The Zotero 7+ desktop app must be **running** with its Local API enabled;
`zot doctor` checks and, if needed, prints the steps to turn it on.

```bash
zot doctor                     # is Zotero reachable, and what can it do?
zot search "state estimation"  # find items
zot show HRAC4E44              # inspect one, with its attachments
zot export bibtex -c Polyhedra # export via Zotero's translators
zot item create < item.json    # create (needs a write-capable Zotero build)
```

Point the same commands at the hosted Web API with `--web`, and get
script-friendly output with `--json` / `--jsonl` / `--raw`. These examples show
common workflows; `zot --help` and `zot <command> --help` are the authoritative
references for current commands, options, and limitations.
